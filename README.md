# CSS display cheat sheet
  
<a href='https://bmhatch.github.io/CSS-display-cheat-sheet'>CSS display cheat sheet</a> is a project I completed as part of the Codecademy Full Stack Engineer Path course I am taking.
  
I had a lot of fun working on this and learned several HTML and CSS skills through the process. 
  
I first made a rough mockup of the website I wanted to build utilizing my graphic design background and Adobe Illustrator:

I then created the HTML code for the website, followed by the CSS styling. 
  
I learned a lot about how to style an HTML table through this project. I also picked up on a few cool new tricks, such as how to utilize <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tags to represent HTML tags and CSS properties and values on a website.
